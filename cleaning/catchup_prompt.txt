We have a Python codebase for cleaning & consolidating trading activity from two brokers (Ally & IB). The files are organized like this:

cleaning/
├─ clean_activity.py
├─ broker_parsers.py
├─ data_helpers.py
├─ options_pipeline.py
├─ fx_pipeline.py
└─ data/
   ├─ Ally/
   │  └─ activity.txt
   ├─ IB/
   │  └─ *.csv
   └─ cleaned/
      ├─ trades.csv
      ├─ unclosed.csv
      ├─ fx_trades.csv
      └─ fx_unclosed.csv

File Roles
	1.	clean_activity.py
	•	Main script (entry point). Run with python clean_activity.py.
	•	Discovers ../data/Ally/activity.txt and ../data/IB/*.csv, parses them with classes in broker_parsers.py, and channels the results into two pipelines:
	•	options_pipeline.py (for options)
	•	fx_pipeline.py (for spot-FX).
	•	Produces final CSV outputs in ../data/cleaned/:
	•	trades.csv (closed option trades)
	•	unclosed.csv (open option positions)
	•	fx_trades.csv (closed FX trades)
	•	fx_unclosed.csv (open FX positions).
	2.	broker_parsers.py
	•	Contains AllyParser and IBParser, both inheriting from BaseBrokerParser.
	•	Each class implements parse_row(row: list) to return a dictionary of standardized fields (date, activity, qty, symbol, etc.) or None if the row is irrelevant.
	•	AllyParser handles Ally’s tab-delimited activity.txt (treats them as options).
	•	IBParser handles IB’s CSV lines (can parse both “Equity and Index Options” rows and “Forex” rows).
	3.	data_helpers.py
	•	Houses low-level utility functions:
	•	parse_currency(x: str) -> float: strips $ and commas, then converts to float.
	•	parse_mixed_date(s: str) -> pd.Timestamp: attempts several date formats or falls back on pandas auto-parsing.
	4.	options_pipeline.py
	•	Functions for cleaning and matching option trades, including:
	•	dicts_to_option_df() to build a pandas DataFrame from the parsed dictionaries.
	•	_extract_option_details() to parse option expiration, strike, etc. from textual descriptions.
	•	merge_simultaneous_fills() to combine partial fills at the same timestamp into a single row.
	•	match_option_trades() to do FIFO matching of open vs. close legs, producing:
	•	A DataFrame of closed trades with net P/L
	•	A DataFrame of unclosed positions still open.
	•	process_options() is the high-level function that calls these steps in sequence.
	5.	fx_pipeline.py
	•	Similar to options_pipeline.py but for spot-FX:
	•	dicts_to_fx_df() converts parsed FX rows into a DataFrame.
	•	match_fx() performs FIFO matching of buys vs. sells, computing net P/L in the quote currency.
	•	process_fx() is the wrapper that calls these and returns final closed-trade and unclosed-lot DataFrames.

Running & Outputs
	•	Run: python clean_activity.py
	•	Inputs:
	•	Ally data in ../data/Ally/activity.txt
	•	IB data in ../data/IB/*.csv
	•	Outputs:
	•	Option trades → ../data/cleaned/trades.csv (closed) + unclosed.csv (open)
	•	FX trades → ../data/cleaned/fx_trades.csv (closed) + fx_unclosed.csv (open)

I have solid working versions of all these modles, but I need some help developing them further.  Can you assist?  If so, I'll say what part I want to work on, show code, etc.
